<h2 class="article-head">Moroccan-style vegetable platter</h2>

  <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 aubergines (about 500g), sliced</li>

      <li>Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and cook the garlic and aubergines, covered, for 10 mins, stirring occasionally until tender and slightly charred. Add the tomatoes and cumin, and cook for 5-10 mins, then turn off the heat. Add the herbs and lemon juice.</li>

<h2 class="article-head">Braised Chicken Legs With Grapes and Fennel</h2>
    <p>Think of the grapes in this chicken recipe as something like a rustic way to braise chicken in wine. Here, though, you get all the flavor—while saving your wine for drinking. Red or green table grapes are sweet but also have just the right amount of acidity for this dish. I build on that with sweet fennel and honey, spicy Calabrian chile paste, and red wine vinegar for brightness. While half of the grapes are breaking down in the bottom of the pan, lending their juices to the sweet-spicy braising liquid, the remaining grapes rest atop the chicken and stay intact, emerging from the oven glistening and burnished. </p>
<ul>
  <li>4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick; about 3½ lb.), patted dry</li>
  <li>4½ tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
  <li>2 medium fennel bulbs (about 1 lb.), plus ¼ cup coarsely chopped fronds</li>
  <li>1 lb. Red Flame or green table grapes, stems removed (about 2 cups)</li>
  <li>1 cup unsalted chicken broth</li>
  <li>¼ cup honey</li>
  <li>4 tsp. Calabrian chile paste or chopped Calabrian chiles</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar</li>
  </ul>
<ol>
  <li>Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 375°F. Season chicken legs all over with 3 tsp. salt.</li>
  <li>Swirl 1 Tbsp. oil in a large Dutch oven or other heavy pot to coat and heat over medium-high. Place 2 chicken legs, skin side down, in pot, making sure skin is in direct contact with pan. Cook, undisturbed, until dark golden, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook until golden on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining 2 chicken legs; reserve pot.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, working one at a time, stand a bulb, root end down, on a cutting board and slice off a short end to create a flat surface. Turn cut side down and slice ½" thick, starting from the top end of bulb so the root end can hold the layers in place while you slice. Discard last ¼" (root end) of each bulb and pop out and discard tougher center from slices. Transfer fennel to a large bowl and add half of the grapes, ½ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Reduce heat to medium and combine broth, honey, chile paste, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in reserved pot. Stir to combine and dissolve salt. Place remaining grapes in pot and arrange chicken legs, skin side up and overlapping if needed, over grapes. Top with dressed fennel and grapes. (Don’t worry if it looks crowded: Fennel will soften as it cooks.)</li>
  <li>Transfer pot, uncovered, to oven and roast until fennel is slightly softened, with some crispy, caramelized edges, grapes on top are swollen and browned in spots, and chicken is cooked through, 30–40 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer grapes and fennel to a bowl and chicken to a platter. Place pot over medium-high heat and bring braising liquid to a simmer. Cook until reduced by half (you should have about 1 cup liquid), 8–10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vinegar and fennel fronds.</li>
      <li>Spoon sauce over chicken and serve with fennel and grapes alongside.</li>

	  <h2 class="article-head">Summer Fruit Icebox Cake</h2>
	  <p>This is the content for Layout P Tag</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>2 1/4 cups cold heavy whipping cream</li>
	    <li>1/4 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
	    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
	    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
	    <li>7 to 8 whole graham crackers (about 1 (4.8 ounce) packet), or more as needed</li>
	    <li>1 large peach - peeled, pitted, and thinly sliced</li>
	    <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
	    <li>1 cup fresh black raspberries or blackberries</li>
      </ul>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Line an 8 1/2x4 1/2- inch loaf pan with enough plastic wrap to have overhang on all sides.</li>
	    <li>Add heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt to a large mixing bowl. Starting on low speed, begin whipping the mixture. Gradually increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until cream holds stiff peaks. Taste whipped cream and add more powdered sugar, if needed or desired.</li>
	    <li>Spread 3 to 4 tablespoons whipped cream evenly into the lined loaf pan to cover the bottom with a thin layer of cream. Place 3 to 4 graham crackers in an even layer over the cream, breaking them to fit as necessary. Spread about 3/4 cup of cream evenly over the graham cracker layer. Sprinkle half of sliced peach, half of blueberries, and half of black raspberries over cream. Spread another 3/4 cup cream over fruit in an even layer. Add another layer of graham crackers, breaking as necessary to fit. Top with another 3/4 cup cream and spread into an even layer. Top with remaining peach slices, blueberries, and black raspberries. Spread remaining cream over fruit. The loaf pan will be very full at this point. If desired, sprinkle icebox cake with graham cracker crumbs.</li>
	    <li>Carefully cover loaf pan with plastic wrap and place cake into the freezer for about 8 hours or overnight.</li>
	    <li>When ready to serve, let cake sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes to soften slightly. Carefully lift cake out of the pan using the plastic wrap overhang; peel plastic wrap off. Run a sharp knife under hot water for several seconds, then dry it off with a towel. Cut icebox cake into slices using the hot knife.</li>
      </ol>
